# Find-S-Algorithm-in-Python
<br>Program reads the data set from data.txt.
<br>Data instances are stored in form of list of lists.
<br>Data from data.txt is read as string.
<br>For example if data instance is <B>['Sunny','Warm','Normal','Strong','Warm','Same','Yes']</B>
<br>Now, we try to fetch elment at the [0] index, we expect to get 'Sunny' but we get '[' instead.
<br>Therefore, to read list as list itself from a file, we make use of <B>literal_eval</B> package in Python.
